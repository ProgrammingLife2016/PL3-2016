Sorry for the late feedback, there was some confusion as to how to and when to send the rubrics to you guys. Below you will find the rubrics for sprint 1.

Note: The Code Evolution Quality part does not count this week. 

A brief explanation for the low grades: Your code readability needs to improve badly, with sometimes entire classes uncommented, no formatting and weird naming conventions. I have seen no testing, and the tooling needs be used better. 

Comments on the Architecture Design document will be there Monday.

If you have any questions, please ask them tonight, as I will be away until Monday.
